Data Visualisations in JavaScript

Code for SPA2012 talk: http://www.spaconference.org/spa2012/sessions/session412.html

Three visualisations: a sunburst using JIT, a nightingale using Raphael and a dynamic stacked barchart using d3.

Each folder contains the html file to display the visualisation, the file to include, a complete version of the file to include (i.e. just change the html so it includes *_complete.js to skip to the end), and a cheat sheet listing you the steps from blank to complete.

In master, the file to include is blank (or may contain an init() function). There are four branches in addition to master - these take you through the stages of each visualisation.
